* Include required (if any) lisence-teksts in application About-screen (done, update if anything changes)
* Improve application flow
* Allow user to input details before sending (possible with current import.cgi)
* Allow user to select point from map, do not force GPS
* Allow user to turn on GPS while it waits for GPS signal
* Allow user to select category before sending. (requires dev-only import.cgi, use category=1 and supply lon/lat)

* Improve flow - when you start the app, there should really be a 
welcome message explaning what FMS is, and a "Click here to take 
a photo" button, then after the photo a "Now add your details" screen. 
At the moment the opening screen doesn't really make sense unless you
already know what FixMyStreet is - it should be more welcoming.
